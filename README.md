# Lane-Detection-Image-Processing-
Here I have used basic Image processing to detect lane, an application for Autonomous Car.

Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV) is a color model that is often used in place of the RGB color model in graphics and paint programs. In using this color model, a color is specified then white or black is added to easily make color adjustments.

The color/HSV for lane marking is constant and can be taken advantage of. The code uses the HSV value to draw out contours of the lane, which on dilating and erroding gives out the smooth segmented lane.

Thank you.
